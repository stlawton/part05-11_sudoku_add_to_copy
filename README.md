This is the very last sudoku task. This time we will create a slightly different version of the function for adding new numbers to the grid.

The function `copy_and_add(sudoku: list, row_no: int, column_no: int, number: int)` takes a two-dimensional array representing a sudoku grid, two integers referring to the row and column indexes of a single square, and a single digit between 1 and 9, as its arguments. The function should return a copy of the original grid with the new digit added in the correct location. The function should not change the original grid received as a parameter.

The print_sudoku function from the previous exercise could be useful for testing, and it is used in the example below:

```
sudoku  = [
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
]

grid_copy = copy_and_add(sudoku, 0, 0, 2)
print("Original:")
print_sudoku(sudoku)
print()
print("Copy:")
print_sudoku(grid_copy)
```
Sample output:
```
Original:
_ _ _  _ _ _  _ _ _
_ _ _  _ _ _  _ _ _
_ _ _  _ _ _  _ _ _

_ _ _  _ _ _  _ _ _
_ _ _  _ _ _  _ _ _
_ _ _  _ _ _  _ _ _

_ _ _  _ _ _  _ _ _
_ _ _  _ _ _  _ _ _
_ _ _  _ _ _  _ _ _

Copy:
2 _ _  _ _ _  _ _ _
_ _ _  _ _ _  _ _ _
_ _ _  _ _ _  _ _ _

_ _ _  _ _ _  _ _ _
_ _ _  _ _ _  _ _ _
_ _ _  _ _ _  _ _ _

_ _ _  _ _ _  _ _ _
_ _ _  _ _ _  _ _ _
_ _ _  _ _ _  _ _ _
```
Hint: When dealing with nested lists you should be extra careful when copying. What all needs to be explicitly copied, and where do changes actually have an effect? The visualisation tool is a great help here, too, although the size of the sudoku grid will make the view less orderly than usual.
